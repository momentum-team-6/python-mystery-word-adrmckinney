# * Computer chooses a word at random (done)
#     * Finds length of that word (done)
#     * Stores all other words of that length (done)
# * User guesses a letter and compare with computer word. If letter exists in computer word, then â€¦next (done)
# * Computer takes that letter and creates word families of every word for every letter position (remembering all previously guessed letters and their positions) (done)
# * Computer looks at longest word family and randomly selects a word (kinda done)
